<h3>Overview</h3>

The stock market has a lot of stocks and at the end of the day, the website will provide https://money.rediff.com/ Gainer and Losers. Based on this we can plan our investment or swing trading ideas. 

The website is not provided with an EXPORT option as CSV or any other formate. 

The project is to demonstrate web scraping using SPARK and DataBricks in Azure. The small code will help us get the CSV data in Data Lake Storage.
